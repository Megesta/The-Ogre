# The-Ogre: An Ordinary Discord bot

## Description
**Hello!** I am `Magesta`, a **Discord** user who thought they mean something for this world. You can contact me through my **Discord** profile: `_magesta` or `Magesta#0590`. I usually don't do something special, but this time everything is different. This bot should have been an introduction to `Java Script`. Honestly, I really enjoyed making it and decided to make it a real bot with its own server. Now you can find it as a moderation bot on my server called `Magesta's Cave`, where I store my portfolio stuff and also sell some of them. If you want to join, contact me, because this server is closed.

## Functionality
This bot wasnt meant to do many different things, but now it does a lot. I'll list some of the main functions it does at the moment you're reading this:
* Adds many different slash commands, such as `/ping`, `/award`, `/ban`, `/report`;
* Lists all the server interactions in a separate channel and provides all the neccessary info with it;
* Acts as **automod**, which means it tracks user messages and moderates if they're breaking server rules;
* Adds many "fun" commands, so users can also have fun while chatting;
* Uses a **ticket system** to allow users contact with me or the closest moderators of mine.

## Changelogs
### 22.07.2025, aka 22, Jule of 2025, Tuesday.
* Made a **GitHub** page of my bot, where you can find the source code;
* Connected the **GitHub** page to my own PC through **GitHub Deckstop**;
* Cooked this `README.md` file so you'd know what to expect;
* Cooked the `LICENSE.md` file so you don't care about being chased by me with wooden club.
### About to do:
* Make the common discord bot structure;
* Add some of the easiest commands;
* Add some of the easiest events.
# That's the first version!
